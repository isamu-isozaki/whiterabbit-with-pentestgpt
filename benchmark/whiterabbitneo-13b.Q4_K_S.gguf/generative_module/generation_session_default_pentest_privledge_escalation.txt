To perform a shell-based privilege escalation attack in the penetration testing environment, you would typically follow these steps:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Gather information about the target system to understand its structure and configuration. This includes identifying the user account you're currently logged in as, the operating system version, the services running on the target system, and potential privilege escalation vectors.
   
   - Use `whoami`, `id` commands to identify the current user account.
   - Use `uname -a` to get the operating system version.
   - Use `netstat -tulpn` to list all active network services with their process IDs (PIDs).
   - Use `ps aux` to list all running processes and their respective users.
   - Use `cat /etc/passwd` to view the list of users on the system.
   - Use `sudo -l` to see what commands the current user can run with sudo privileges.
   - Use `sudo -l` to see if there is a command that can be used to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
   - Use `grep -i "password" /etc/*/*` to search for potential password files that might contain passwords in plain text.
   - Use `locate -r 'bin/bash$' | grep -v '(^/proc)' | grep -v '(^/sys)' | grep -v '(^/dev)' | grep -v '(^/run)' | grep -v '(^/var/log)' | grep -v '(^/var/cache)' | grep -v '(^/var/lock)' | grep -v '(^/var/lib)' | grep -v '(^/var/spool)' | grep -v '(^/var/tmp)' | grep -v '(^/lib)' | grep -v '(^/usr/lib)' | grep -v '(^/etc/init)' | grep -v '(^/etc/rc)' | grep -v '(^/etc/rc.d)' | grep -v '(^/etc/rc2.d)' | grep -v '(^/etc/rc3.d)' | grep -v '(^/etc/rc4.d)' | grep -v '(^/etc/rc5.d)' | grep -v '(^/etc/rc6.d)' | grep -v '(^/etc/rc.local)' | grep -v '(^/etc/crontab)' | grep -v '(^/etc/sysconfig)' | grep -v '(^/etc/xinetd.d)' | grep -v '(^/etc/init.d)' | grep -v '(^/etc/systemd)' | grep -v '(^/etc/default)' | grep -v '(^/etc/logrotate.d)' | grep -v '(^/etc/systemd/system)' | grep -v '(^/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants)' | grep -v '(^/etc/systemd
