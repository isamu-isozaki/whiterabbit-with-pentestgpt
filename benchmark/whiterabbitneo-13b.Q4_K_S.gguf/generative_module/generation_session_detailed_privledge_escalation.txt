To perform privledge escalation in a shell, you can use several methods depending on the system you're working on. Here's an outline of the steps you might take:

1. **Initial Access**: This step assumes you have already gained access to the system. If you haven't, you need to use various exploits or methods to gain access to the system.

2. **Find Vulnerable System**: Once you've gained access to the system, you need to find out if there are any known vulnerabilities that can be exploited for privilege escalation. This can be done by scanning the system for open ports, outdated software versions, or other known weaknesses. Tools like Nmap can be used for this purpose.

3. **Identify Exploitable Vulnerabilities**: Once you've identified potential vulnerabilities, you need to choose an exploit that matches the vulnerability you've found. This can be done using search engines like Google or exploit-db.

4. **Configure Exploit**: Based on the chosen exploit, you need to configure the exploit to target the vulnerability on the system you've identified. This often involves setting options such as RHOST (remote host IP), RPORT (remote port), LHOST (local host IP for reverse connections), LPORT (local port for reverse connections), etc.

5. **Execute Exploit**: Execute the exploit with the configured options. If successful, the exploit will provide you with a shell with higher privileges on the system.

6. **Privledge Escalation**: After gaining access to the system, you can attempt to escalate privileges to root or an equivalent user using various methods such as:
   - Using the `sudo` command to gain root privileges if the user you've logged in with has sudo privileges.
   - Using known exploits for the underlying operating system (e.g., Linux kernel vulnerabilities).
   - Using credential dumping tools to find credentials in memory that can be used to access other systems with higher privileges.
   - Using tools like `passwd` to change the user's password to something you know if you have access to the user's account.
   - Modifying system configuration files to add your user to the sudoers file to gain root privileges without needing to escalate further.

7. **Maintain Access**: After escalating privileges, maintain access by ensuring you can re-establish access to the system even if you
