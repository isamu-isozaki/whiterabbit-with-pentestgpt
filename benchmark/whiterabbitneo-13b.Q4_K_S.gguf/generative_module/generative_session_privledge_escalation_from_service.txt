To escalate privileges on a linux system, we can use various techniques such as exploiting misconfigurations, using known vulnerabilities in services running on the system, or leveraging the root user's password being weak or unprotected. Below is an outline of steps one might take to attempt privledge escalation on such a system:

1. **Check for Misconfigurations:**
   - Look for misconfigurations in services that may be running with excessive privileges. For example, services that are configured to run as root but should not be. Tools like `ps aux` can be used to check which services are running under root privileges.
   - Use `sudo -l` to check what commands the current user can run with sudo without needing a password. This can reveal if there is a way to escalate privileges using sudo.
   - Check the permissions of the `/etc/shadow` file to see if it is world-readable which could allow an attacker to read the hashed passwords of all users.
   - Look for writable files in sensitive directories like `/etc/`, `/usr/local/`, `/var/`, `/srv/`, etc., that might allow you to modify configuration files that could grant you more privileges.
2. **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities:**
   - Search for known vulnerabilities in the services running on the system using tools like `searchsploit`. This can reveal if there are any known exploits for the services that can be used to gain higher privileges.
   - If the system has an outdated version of a service with known vulnerabilities, this could be exploited to gain higher privileges. Tools like `nmap` with scripts can be used to scan for outdated software versions.
3. **Use SUID/GUID Files:**
   - Search for SUID (set-user-ID) and GUID (set-group-ID) files that could be exploited to gain higher privileges. Tools like `find` with the `-perm` flag can be used to find these files.
   - Execute these files with the permissions of their owner/group to escalate privileges if the owner/group has higher privileges than the current user.
4. **Check for Weak Passwords:**
   - Use tools like `John the Ripper` to attempt to crack the root user's password hash if it's found to be weak or unprotected. The hash can be obtained from `/etc/shadow`.
5. **Use Stored Credentials:**
   - Check for stored credentials in files such as `.bash_history`, `.bash
