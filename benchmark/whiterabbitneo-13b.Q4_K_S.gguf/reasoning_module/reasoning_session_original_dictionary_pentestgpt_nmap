1. **Passive Information Gathering**
           - The system has been scanned for network-based vulnerabilities using various techniques like Nmap or similar tools.
        2. **Active Information Gathering**
           - The system has been scanned for network-based vulnerabilities using various techniques like Nmap or similar tools. This includes probing for open ports, attempting to identify services running on these ports, and possibly obtaining more detailed information about these services if possible or desirable.
        3. **Identify Open Ports and Services**
           - Port scanning using Nmap or similar tools has been performed to identify open ports on the system. This includes both TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)), UDP (User Datagram Protocol)), and other protocols ports that may be used by services on the system. This includes probing for open ports and attempting to identify services running on these ports.
        4. **Perform a full port scan**
           - The full port scan has been performed using Nmap or similar tools. This scan includes detailed service information for open ports that are found to be open on the system. This includes probing for open ports, attempting to identify services running on these ports, and possibly obtaining more detailed information about these services if possible or desirable.
        5. **Determine the purpose of each open open port**
           - The purpose of each open port has been determined by probing for service information on open ports using Nmap or similar tools. This includes probing for open open ports, attempting to identify services running on these ports, and possibly obtaining more detailed information about these services if possible or desirable.
        6. **Expand this task into detailed steps for the tester to perform**
           - The detailed steps for the tester to perform on expanding this task have been generated. These detailed steps include using Nmap or similar tools for performing port scans on open ports on the system to identify services running on these ports, probing for detailed service information on open open ports on the system using Nmap or similar tools, and possibly obtaining more detailed information about these services if possible or desirable.
        7. **Todo**
           - The detailed steps for the tester to perform on expanding this todo have been generated. These detailed steps include using Nmap or similar tools for performing port scans on open open ports on the system to identify services running on these ports, probing for detailed service information on open open open ports on the system using Nmap or similar tools, and possibly obtaining more detailed information about these services if possible or desirable.
