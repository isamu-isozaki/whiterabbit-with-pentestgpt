 is also possible.

### Method 1: Using Sudo
```shell
$ sudo su -
```

This will prompt for your password and if correct you will have root privileges.

### Method 2: Logging in as Root User Directly
If you know the root user's password, you can login to root account directly using the `su` command without using `-c`.

```shell
$ su -
Password:
```
Enter the root user's password and it will log you into the root account.

### Method 3: Using SudoBypass
If you are not sure if the root user has a password, you can use `SudoBypass` to bypass the requirement of entering the sudo password. You need to have the SudoBypass binary installed and executable with sufficient privileges.

```shell
$ cp /usr/share/bypass-rootkit/binaries/.SudoBypass ./
$ chmod +x .SudoBypass
$ ./SudoBypass
[sudo bypass] Starting up...
[sudo bypass] Attempting to get root shell..
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
This will give you a root shell if SudoBypass is executed with enough privileges.

### Method 4: Using /etc/shadow
The `/etc/shadow` file contains the encrypted passwords of all users on the system. If you have read and write access to this file, you can change the password of any user without knowing the current password. You can use tools like `passwd` or `chsh` with `--skip-chown` option.

```shell
$ passwd --skip-chown root
New password: 
Retype new password: 
passwd: password updated successfully
```
This changes the password for the root user without knowing the current password, which could be used if you have write access to `/etc/shadow` or have a command with `--skip-chown`.

### Method 5: Using Exploits
If there are known exploits that can be used to gain root privileges (e.g., a buffer overflow in a vulnerable binary), these can also be used for privilege escalation.

### Method 6: Kernel Exploitation
Kernel exploits target the kernel itself, not specific applications or binaries. If there's a vulnerability within the kernel that can be exploited to gain root privileges, you might find such an exploit.

```shell
$ searchsploit [kernel version]
```
Then, use any of the available exploits for the kernel version you are running.

### Method 7: /etc/passwd
The `/etc/passwd` file is a text file containing user information, including usernames and their corresponding IDs (UIDs). If an attacker can modify this file, they can change the UID of a regular user to be that of root.

```shell
$ usermod -aG sudo your_user
```
This command will add the `sudo` group to your user, allowing you to run commands with root privileges if necessary.

### Method 8: /usr/bin/login
The `/usr/bin/login` binary can be used to log in as another user without their password by using the `-f` (--fast) option.

```shell
$ su -l [username]
```
This command will simulate a login for that user, allowing you to gain root privileges if you are already logged in as that user or any other user with the same UID.

### Method 9: Chroot Escape
If you have write access to `/`, you can create your own chroot jail and use it as a way out of restricted environments, like inside a container (LXC, Docker).

```shell
$ mknod /dev/tty c 5 0 && exec sh --noprofile --norc <&- >&-
```
This will create `/dev/tty` and execute a shell without startup files. You can now execute commands as root inside the chroot jail.

### Method 10: Using System Binaries
Sometimes, system binaries that are not running under `chroot` or other sandbox environments can be used to gain higher privileges if they have been compiled with certain vulnerabilities.

```shell
$ /usr/bin/env -i sh --noprofile --
