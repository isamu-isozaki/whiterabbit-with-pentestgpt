```

This shows us that there are two ports, HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443 open. We can now attempt to enumerate these services using a more detailed scan with Nmap.

### Enumerating the Web Service with Nmap

Using `nmap` we can perform an enumeration of all services on the target machine, including web servers:

```bash
nmap -sV -A 142.250.80.46
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-02-05 06:09 JST
Nmap scan report for lga34s34-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.80.46)
Host is up (0.053s latency).
Not shown: 997 filtered ports
PORT    STATE SERVICE       VERSION
80/tcp  open  http          Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd 2.0 (SSDP/UPnP)
|_http-favicon: Unknown favicon MD5 hash: C4FBA1369CEFD6CABE7BEB3D9A0260CC

Warning: OSScan results may be unreliable because we could not find at least 1 open and 1 closed port
Against 142.250.80.46
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 13.27 seconds
```

We can see from the scan results that there is a Microsoft IIS web server running on both port 80 and 443, as well as some additional information about its SSL certificate.

### Enumerating the Web Service with a Browser

Opening up a browser to `http://142.250.80.46` or `https://142.250.80.46` reveals that the server is hosting a default IIS website. We can attempt to enumerate the site for any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities by searching for known exploits and information disclosures.

### Enumerating the Web Service with Nessus

We can also use a tool like `Nessus` for vulnerability assessment. The process involves installing Nessus, setting up a scan policy, configuring the target (the IP address), choosing the appropriate plugins to run against the server, and then running the scan. The results will show any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations found.

### Enumerating the Web Service with Burp Suite

Burp Suite is a powerful tool that can be used for both manual and automated testing of web applications. You can
