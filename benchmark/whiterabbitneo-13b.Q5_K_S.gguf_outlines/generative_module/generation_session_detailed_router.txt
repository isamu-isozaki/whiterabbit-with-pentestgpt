 that was developed by the [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) project,

## Requirements
- A computer with a good Internet connection, or a VPN to access the Internet from your local network.
- An OpenWRT-compatible router that supports TFTP/TFTPD functionality (e.g., WRT54GL, WR740N, WRT1200AC).
- A USB flash drive with enough space for the OpenWRT firmware image (â‰¥2GB recommended).
- The `tftp`, `dd` and `scp` tools installed on your computer. If you're on a Linux system, these should be available by default. On MacOS, they can be installed using Homebrew (`brew install tftp-hpa dd`).

## Setup Steps
1. Download the OpenWRT firmware image for your router from [OpenWRT.org](https://openwrt.org/releases/). Look for the "imagebuilder" download or the specific firmware for your device.
2. Write the downloaded image to a USB flash drive using `dd`. **Warning: this will overwrite all data on your flash drive!**
   ```sh
   dd if=openwrt-firmware.bin of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress
   ```
3. Insert the USB flash drive into your router, then connect it to a LAN port and power it on.
4. Use `tftp` to send the OpenWRT firmware to the router's TFTP server:
   ```sh
   tftp -i 192.168.1.1 put openwrt-firmware.bin
   ```
5. Power cycle the router again, and during boot press the button for entering the firmware update mode (e.g., holding down reset or power buttons). Your router should boot from TFTP now.
6. When prompted to choose a file, enter `openwrt-firmware.bin`. The router will then proceed with the installation.
7. After installation is complete, you can login to the router using your default credentials (usually username: "root", password: "password").
8. Change the root password and configure the network settings. You may also want to install additional packages for your specific setup.
9. Save and reboot the router when ready. It should now be running OpenWRT with the new firmware!

## Troubleshooting
- If you get a "Permission denied" error message, ensure that the USB flash drive is recognized by Linux (use `lsblk` to verify).
- If you're unable to access the router's TFTP server, try resetting the router and trying again. The TFTP server may not start immediately after powering on.
- If you get a "not found" error message during the update process, ensure that the image file is correctly named and in the correct location (usually `/tftpboot` directory).
