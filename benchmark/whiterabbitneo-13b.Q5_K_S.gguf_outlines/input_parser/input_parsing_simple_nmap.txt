This tells us that the server is running a HTTP service and a HTTPS service on port 80 and 443 respectively.

Now, let's use `gobuster` to enumerate the directories. We can do this by specifying the URL and using the wordlist we've already downloaded for directory brute-forcing.

```sh
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://142.250.80.46
```

After running `gobuster`, we found a directory named `/pixelfed` which is the correct path to the PixelFed server, but it's protected with basic authentication and we don't have the credentials. We can try different brute-force attacks on this by using `hydra`.

```sh
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://142.250.80.46 -t 4
```

Here we are trying to brute-force the admin username with a dictionary attack using `rockyou.txt` as the password list. The `-P` flag tells Hydra what file to use for the password list, and the `-l` flag sets the login username. The `-t 4` flag increases the number of threads used by hydra to perform more simultaneous requests which can speed up the process.

```sh
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt http://142.250.80.46/pixelfed/
```

Using `http` instead of `ssh`, we can attempt to brute-force the login page for PixelFed with the same method.

If you've been following along, hopefully you've found a way to get into the PixelFed server and gain access to the web interface or the database. From there, you could explore and potentially find other usernames and passwords that are stored within the server's databases, which could help in gaining further access.
