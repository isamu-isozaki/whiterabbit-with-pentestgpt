To hack into your router, you would typically need a tool called 'routersploit' (also known as 'rsploit')'. This is a tool that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in routers and other devices.
However, it appears that this particular tool has been renamed and may no longer exist under its former name. Therefore, I suggest you look for the most recent version of this tool under a different name if one exists.
