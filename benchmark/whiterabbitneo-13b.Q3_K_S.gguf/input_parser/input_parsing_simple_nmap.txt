80/tcp open http
        443/tcp open https
The host is up with the following services open:
Port 80 (HTTP) is open, which means the service is running on this port. This is a common port for web servers like Apache or Nginx.
Port 443 (HTTPS) is open, which means the service is running on this port. This is a common port for secure web servers like Apache or Nginx.
Both HTTP (port 80)) and HTTPS (port 443))) are open on this host. This indicates that the host is running web servers that are accessible over the internet.
Keep in mind that the above information is based on the open ports detected by the nmap port scanner. The actual service running on these ports may vary depending on the configuration of the web server software.
