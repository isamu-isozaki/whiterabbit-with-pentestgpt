1. Summarizing Test Results:
            - Vulnerable/Non-Vulnerable Services: The output will list down all the services that are vulnerable or non-vulnerable based on the vulnerability assessment findings.
        2. Keeping Both Finding's Field Name and Value:
            - Port Number and the Service Name/Version if a Port is Open: The output will list down all the open ports along with the service name/version if the service version is available or if the service is not identified by the port number alone.
        3. Summarizing without Concluding or Making Assumptions:
            - The output will summarize the findings from the security testing tool without making assumptions or any conclusions. The output should be short and precise, which will help the output be compliant with the requirements of the large language model.
By following these steps, you are summarizing the information provided by the security testing tool without making assumptions or any conclusions.
