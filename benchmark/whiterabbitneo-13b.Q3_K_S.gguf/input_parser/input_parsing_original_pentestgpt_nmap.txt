 The scan results for the IP address `142.250.80.46` show:
- Port 80 is open for HTTP traffic (web server).
- Port 443 is open for HTTPS traffic (web server with TLS/SSL).
Based on the information provided by the scan results, the web server is running on ports 80 and 443. The service is running on the default ports for HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443). The service is open and may be vulnerable to various exploits depending on the version of the web server running. It is important to note that the actual services running on these ports can vary based on the server configuration and the specific version of the web server software.

It is also important to note that the actual services running on these ports can vary based on the server configuration and the specific version of the web server software. For example, the web server might be configured to run additional services on different ports, or the version of the web server software could be outdated, which could lead to known vulnerabilities being exploited.

The summary should be taken back to the penetration tester for further analysis, such as service version detection, checking for known vulnerabilities for the identified services, and potentially initiating further testing if the services appear to be vulnerable.
