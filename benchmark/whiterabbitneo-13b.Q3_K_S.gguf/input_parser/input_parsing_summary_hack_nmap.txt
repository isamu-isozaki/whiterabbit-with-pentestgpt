80/tcp open  http
443/tcp open  https
The scan results show that ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)) are open on the host you are scanning.
These ports are commonly used by web servers to serve web pages over the HTTP protocol (port 80)) and over the HTTPS protocol (port 443)) respectively.
By default, the web server listens on these ports. However, it is also possible that the web server is not listening on these ports or that the ports are filtered by the firewall or any other network security device.
Please note that the above scan results are based on the assumption that the host you are scanning has not been configured to block these ports or to filter these ports through any other network security device.
If you are not sure whether the ports are open or filtered, you can run additional scans with the Nmap tool using the appropriate command line options to determine the exact state of the ports on the target host or network segment.
