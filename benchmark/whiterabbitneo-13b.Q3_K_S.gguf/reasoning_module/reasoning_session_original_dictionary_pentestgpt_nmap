1) Generate detailed steps for performing sub-task "todo":
            To perform sub-task "todo", the tester should:
            - Identify the open port (port 22) on the target machine.
            - Determine if there are any services running on this port using port scanning tools such as Nmap.
            - Confirm the version of the operating system on the target machine using banner grabbing techniques such as Nmap's -O option.
            - After gathering all this information, analyze it to understand the network and systems better.
            - Based on the gathered information, make decisions about the network environment for further security testing.
            - Record all these findings, decisions, and actions in the tester's log file for future use.
        2) After performing sub-task "todo", move on to the next task which is "Passive Information Gathering".
            For this task, perform the following steps:
            - Identify any information leakage or disclosure issues on the target machine by scanning through public documents, files, databases, and other data sources.
            - Evaluate if any sensitive or critical data could potentially be exposed or disclosed due to lack of proper access controls or other security measures not implemented properly.
            - If any potential issues are found, document them for the tester's log file for future use.
        3) Continue moving on to the next task "Active Information Gathering"".
            For this task, perform the following steps:
            - Enumerate all live hosts within the target network or environment and attempt to connect to each of these hosts to gather information actively.
            - For each host that can be reached, perform tests such as port scanning, service banner grabbing, and other scanning or probing techniques to gather as much information as possible from each live host within the target environment or network.
            - Document all gathered information for each live host within the target environment or network for future use by the tester.
        4) After completing all tasks from "Passive Information Gathering" to "Active Information Gathering", move on to the final task which is "Determine the purpose of each open port".
            For this final task, perform the following steps:
            - Determine the purpose of each open port found during the "Passive Information Gathering" phase by analyzing the services running on each port using banner grabbing techniques such as Nmap's -O option.
            - Record all findings and conclusions from this analysis for each open port within the target environment or network for future use by the tester.
        5) After completing all tasks for the final "Determine the purpose of each open port" task, move on to the final phase of the training process.
        6) The final phase of the training process involves conducting a security assessment review and approval process for the finalized security assessment report.
        7) This final phase involves obtaining the finalized security assessment report from the tester after completing all tasks of the security assessment training.
        8) After obtaining the finalized security assessment report, the security assessor or manager responsible for conducting security assessments reviews and approvals should review this finalized security assessment report for any discrepancies or missing information that needs to be addressed before the report can be considered complete for its intended purpose of providing a comprehensive security assessment of the target environment or network for future use by the security assessor or manager responsible for conducting security assessments reviews and approvals.
        9) After completing this final phase of the security assessment training process and obtaining the finalized security assessment report, the security assessor or manager responsible for conducting security assessments reviews and approvals should document this entire security assessment training process from start to finish for future use by the security assessor or manager responsible for conducting security assessments reviews and approvals for continued improvements in the quality of security assessments conducted within the organization or by external security assessors or managers responsible for conducting security assessments reviews and approvals.
