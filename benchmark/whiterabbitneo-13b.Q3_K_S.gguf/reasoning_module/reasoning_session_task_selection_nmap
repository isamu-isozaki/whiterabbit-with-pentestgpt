1) The tasks are in layered dictionary structure.
        2) Each task has a completion status: inprogress, todo, done, or n/a.
        3) You are given one specific sub-task labeled as todo.
        4) User input information obtained from doing the task marked as in progress is evaluated for future strategies.
        5) A new task as inprogress with minimal modifications is chosen based on strategic priorities and information gleaned from user input.
        6) The PTT is modified using critical thinking to balance the need for strategic planning with the imperative to adapt to change quickly and decisively.
        7) The expansion of tasks is synthesized into further expansion of the tasks in the PTT while choosing exactly one task to mark as in progress. The expansion is strategically balanced with each sub-component addressing constraints while also contributing to the overall goal.
        8) The insights from the reasoning chain are synthesized into further expansion of the tasks in the PTT while choosing exactly one task to mark as in progress. The expansion is strategically balanced with each sub-component addressing constraints while also contributing to the overall goal.
        9) The tasks with redundant/outdated information are removed from the task list to keep tasks clear, precise and short due to token size limit.

        10) The key insights from the reasoning chain are explained with explanatory details on why certain options were considered more or less ideal to make the thought process transparent.

        11) If it was determined that there is a gap in the reasoning chain, backtrack and explore alternative hypotheses to plug the gap until there is a complete logical flow.

        12) The critical analysis of each hypothesis based on validity, relevance to the current completion status, and how well it addresses the sub-component when logically combined with other steps is conducted using structured critical thinking skills to ensure rationality and coherence throughout the logical reasoning chain.
