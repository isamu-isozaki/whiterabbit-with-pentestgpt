 To perform privledge escalation on Linux systems, one common technique is to exploit vulnerabilities in services that are running with higher privileges than the current user has access to. However, since we cannot create services in Linux systems as the `root` user, we need to find another way to escalate privileges. Here's a step-by-step approach to doing so:

1. **Check for SUID/GUID Binaries**: Look for binaries with the SUID (Set User ID) or GUID (Set Group ID) bit set. These binaries execute with the permissions of the file owner or group owner, respectively. By checking for such binaries, we can attempt to execute them with higher privileges if we have write access to them.

   ```bash
   find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. **Check for World-Writable Binaries**: These binaries can be modified by anyone on the system. If we can modify them, we can replace the binary with our own malicious code that will be executed with the same permissions as the binary itself.

   ```bash
   find / -perm -222 -type f 2>/dev/null
   ```

3. **Find Writable Directories**: These directories can be modified by anyone on the system. If we can write to these directories, we can place our malicious code and execute it later.

   ```bash
   find / -type d \( -exec ls -ld {} \; \) | grep 'w.*'
   ```

4. **Check for Weak Passwords**: Some services might be running with default credentials that can be easily guessed or brute-forced.

   ```bash
   grep -r 'password' /etc/ | grep -v 'md5' | grep -v 'sha' | grep -v 'ssh' | grep -v 'mysql' | grep -v 'postgres' | grep -v 'root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash' | grep -v 'nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/bin/sh' | grep -v 'root' | grep -v 'nobody' | grep -v '^#' | grep -v '^$' | grep -v '^/etc/pam.d/' | grep -v '^
