1. **Obtain Access**: The first step is to access the router. This can be done through the use of a wireless connection or by physically connecting to the router using an Ethernet cable.
        2. **Bypass Security Mechanisms**: The next step is to bypass any security mechanisms such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS)), or authentication mechanisms. This can often be done by manipulating settings or by exploiting vulnerabilities in these mechanisms.
        3. **Access Router Settings**: With access to the router, we can now proceed to access its settings. This can be done through the user interface (UI) of the router.
        4. **Modify Router Settings**: With access to the router settings, we can now proceed to modify these settings. For example, changing the router's IP address can alter how it connects to the network.
        5. **Configure Network**: With modifications made to router settings, we can now proceed to configure the network. This can involve setting up DHCP servers, configuring network routing tables, and other network configuration tasks.
        6. **Access Network Resources**: With network configured and router settings modified, we can now proceed to access network resources. This can involve accessing network-attached storage devices (NAS) or other network resources.
        7. **Perform Penetration Testing Activities**: With network configured, router settings modified, and access to network resources obtained, we can now proceed to perform penetration testing activities. This includes conducting vulnerability assessments, exploiting vulnerabilities for unauthorized access or data extraction, and reporting findings for further actions by authorized personnel.
        8. **Document Results**: With penetration testing activities completed, we can now proceed to document results. This can include capturing screenshots, video recordings, or other forms of documentation that demonstrate the results of penetration testing activities.
        9. **Evaluate Results for Appropriateness**: With results documented, we can now proceed to evaluate these results for appropriateness. This can involve determining if the results align with the objectives of the penetration testing engagement or whether they are contrary to those objectives.
        10. **Recommend Next Steps**: With results evaluated for appropriateness, we can now proceed to recommend next steps based on the evaluation results. This can involve making recommendations for actions that should be taken to address any discrepancies found during evaluation.
        11. **Report Findings**: With recommendations for next steps made based on results evaluation, we can now proceed to report findings based on these recommendations. This can involve preparing a report documenting the findings of the penetration testing engagement along with recommendations for further actions by authorized personnel.
