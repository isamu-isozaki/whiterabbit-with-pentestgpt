To perform privilege escalation in a shell without knowing the root password, we can use various techniques such as exploiting misconfigurations, using stolen credentials, or leveraging system vulnerabilities. However, without knowing the root password, we cannot use the `su` command to escalate privileges directly. Instead, we can look for misconfigurations or vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

1. **Check for Misconfigurations**: Look for services that may be running with higher privileges than they should have access to. For example, services running with `sudo` permissions may have their credentials cached in memory.
2. **Check for Stored Credentials**: Unintentionally left credentials in configuration files can be exploited.
3. **Exploit System Vulnerabilities**: Search for known vulnerabilities in the system that can be exploited to gain higher privileges.
4. **Use the Exploit of the Year**: Sometimes, there's an exploit that is well-known to be effective against certain versions of software.
5. **Exploit Privilege Escalation Flaws**: Use known privilege escalation exploits that target the system's kernel version.

Here's an example of how you might proceed with these steps:

1. **Check for Cached Credentials**: Use `sudo -l` to see if you can run any commands with elevated privileges without needing the password. If you find commands that you can run with `sudo`, you can use the `-S` flag to attempt to use your cached credentials to escalate privileges.
```bash
sudo -l
sudo -u root -i
```
2. **Check for Stored Credentials**: Look for configuration files that contain credentials in plain text. For example, in a MySQL configuration file:
```bash
sudo grep -r 'password' /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/
```
3. **Exploit System Vulnerabilities**: Use commands like `uname -a` to check the kernel version and search for known vulnerabilities:
```bash
uname -a
searchsploit [kernel version]
```
4. **Use the Exploit of the Year**: If you find an exploit for a specific version of software, download it and attempt to run it:
```bash
exploit_name -h
./exploit_name
```
5. **Exploit Privilege Escalation Flaws**: Use tools like `getcap`
