1. Obtain router credentials (if not already provided):
                    a. If provided with credentials (username and password), proceed to step 2.
        2. Connect to the router using SSH or Telnet with the provided credentials:
                    a. If using SSH, execute `ssh username@routeripaddress`.
                    b. If using Telnet, execute `telnet routeripaddress` and then enter the username and password when prompted.
        3. Once connected, check the router configuration for any suspicious settings or services that could be exploited:
                    a. Use `show running-config` or equivalent command for your router type to display the current configuration settings.
                    b. Look for unusual or unexpected settings that could be exploited. For example, services running on ports that are not expected to be open may be exploited if they are vulnerable.
        4. If any suspicious settings are found, take action to remediate these settings immediately:
                    a. Use commands like `configure terminal` followed by `interface <interface_name>` followed by `<interface_name> shutdown` or equivalent commands for your router type to disable any suspicious services or interfaces.
                    b. After disabling any suspicious services or interfaces, use `show running-config` or equivalent command for your router type again to confirm that the settings have been properly disabled or remediated.
        5. If you are unable to connect or remediate suspicious settings using the provided credentials, you may need to reset or change the router credentials (username and password))):
                    a. If you can reset router credentials, follow the instructions provided by your router manufacturer to reset router credentials.
                    b. If you cannot reset router credentials but you can change router credentials, follow the instructions provided by your router manufacturer to change router credentials.
        6. If you are still unable to connect or remediate suspicious settings using provided credentials, you may need to manually reset or change router credentials (username and password))):
                    a. If you can manually reset router credentials, follow the instructions provided by your router manufacturer to manually reset router credentials.
                    b. If you cannot manually reset router credentials but you can manually change router credentials, follow the instructions provided by your router manufacturer to manually change router credentials.
        7. After attempting all methods to connect or remediate suspicious settings using provided credentials, if you are still unable to connect or remediate suspicious settings, you may need to contact the manufacturer of your router for assistance or to report a security issue with your router.
        8. Finally, if you have followed all the previous steps and are still unable to connect or remediate suspicious settings using provided credentials, you may need to change your router or consider a new router that may not have the same issues or security vulnerabilities that your current router has.
