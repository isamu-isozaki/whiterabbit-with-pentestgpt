1. Identify the target system.
        2. Enumerate all potential privilege escalation vectors.
        3. Analyze each vector for potential weaknesses or misconfigurations that could be exploited.
        4. Develop a methodology for identifying and exploiting these weaknesses.
        5. Execute the methodology against the target system.
        6. Document the findings, including any successful privilege escalations or exploitations of weaknesses.
        7. Report the findings back to the tester, who can then take appropriate actions based on the findings.
Following these steps, a skilled penetration tester can effectively escalate privileges within a target system, potentially gaining higher-level access.
