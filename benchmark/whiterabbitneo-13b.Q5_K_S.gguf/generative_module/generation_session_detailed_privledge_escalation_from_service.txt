 Let's start by analyzing the task:

1. **Analyze the task**: The task asks us to create services in a linux system as root user and then perform privledge escalation to root user. The key components here are:
   - Creating services: This involves creating scripts or configurations that can be executed to create services.
   - Privledge escalation: This involves gaining higher privileges on the system, typically through exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
   - As the system is already running as root user, we need to find a way to escalate privileges further without using the root user's password.

2. **Break down the task**:
   - **Create services**: We need to create services that will be run with root privileges without using the root user's password.
   - **Privledge escalation**: We need to exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain higher privileges on the system.

3. **Logical sub-tasks**:
   - **Create services**:
     - Identify methods to create services that will run with root privileges without using root's password (e.g., cron jobs, systemd services).
     - Determine how to create such services without using the root user's password (e.g., using sudo with NOPASSWD).
   - **Privledge escalation**:
     - Identify potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that could be exploited to gain higher privileges.
     - Research methods to exploit these vulnerabilities (e.g., SUID binaries, misconfigured services).
     - Develop a plan to exploit these vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges without using root's password.

4. **Explore multiple reasoning paths**:
   - **Create services**:
     - **Method 1:** Create cron jobs to execute scripts with root privileges. This can be done by editing the crontab of the root user with the `sudo crontab -e` command and adding a line to run the script at an appropriate time. The script itself can be made executable by root and have the setuid bit set with `chmod u+s script`. This will run the script with root privileges without needing the root password.
     - **Method 2:** Use systemd services to execute scripts with root privileges. This can be done by creating a new service unit file in `/etc/systemd/system/` with the
