To perform the task of hacking into the router, you would need to follow these steps:

1. **Preparation**: Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary tools and permissions to perform the penetration test. This includes legal authorization to access the network in question and the equipment necessary to perform the test.

2. **Network Scanning**: Use network scanning tools to identify the IP address of the router. Tools like Nmap can be used for this purpose. The command to scan the network for hosts would be:
   ```sh
   nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
   ```
   Replace `192.168.1.0/24` with the appropriate network range.

3. **Identifying the Router**: After identifying the IP address of the router, you can now move on to the next step. If the router is using a default username and password, you can attempt to log in using the following command:
   ```sh
   ssh user@router_ip_address
   ```
   Replace `user` with the default username (usually `admin`) and `router_ip_address` with the actual IP address of the router. If the router has a default password (often `admin` or `password`), you can try it without further confirmation. If not, proceed to the next step.

4. **Brute Force Attack**: If the router does not have the default username and password, you can use tools like Hydra to perform a brute force attack on the router's SSH service:
   ```sh
   hydra -l admin -P /path/to/password/list -s router_ssh_port router_ip_address ssh
   ```
   Replace `router_ssh_port` with the SSH port number of the router (usually 22) and `/path/to/password/list` with the path to your password list file.

5. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**: If the router is vulnerable to known exploits, you can use tools like Metasploit to exploit these vulnerabilities. First, identify the vulnerability (e.g., CVE number) and then use Metasploit to exploit it:
   ```sh
   msfconsole
   use exploit/[vulnerability_name]
   set RHOST router_ip_address
   set RPORT router_ssh_port
   exploit
   ```
   Replace `[vulnerability_name]` with the actual exploit module name (e.g., `exploit/unix/ssh/some_ssh_exploit`) and `router_ip_address` with the IP address of the router.

6. **Accessing the Router**: Once you have gained access to the router, you can explore the system for further vulnerabilities and privileges.

7. **Documentation**: After completing the penetration test, document all findings and steps taken in a report for the tester to review. This report should include the method used to gain access, the vulnerabilities found, and the steps taken to maintain access.
