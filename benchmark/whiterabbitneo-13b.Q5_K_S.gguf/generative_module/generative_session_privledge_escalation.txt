To perform privledge escalation in a shell, one must first understand that it involves gaining higher-level access to the system than what is normally available to the user account you're currently using. Here's how you can attempt to do it:

1. **Check for Unprivileged Access Methods**:
   - Look for writable directories that the user can write to, which might allow them to add files that will be executed with elevated privileges.
   - Search for world-writable directories that the user can write to, which could be used to place malicious files that will be executed by other users.
   - Check for SUID/SGID executable files that the user can modify or execute that could give them higher privileges if they are exploited.
   - Look for writable configuration files that could be modified to change system behavior without needing root access.
   - Check if the user has access to any other user's private SSH keys, which could be used to log in as that user with root privileges if the key is unprotected.
   - Check for world-writable directories in the `/etc/` directory that contain configuration files for services that the user can modify to gain higher privileges.
   - Search for cron jobs that the user can modify to execute scripts with root privileges at certain times (e.g., through cron's `@reboot` directive).
   - Check for writable log files that could be modified to log privileged actions.
   - Look for writable `/tmp/` directories that could be used to create temporary files with root access.

2. **Exploit Writable Directories**:
   - If you find a writable directory such as `/tmp/`, you can write a script to it that will be executed with the privileges of the directory's owner (typically root).
   - Place a malicious script in the directory that will be executed when another user with write access to the directory runs a command that causes the script to be executed (e.g., `cat > /tmp/script`).
   - If you find a world-writable directory, you can place your malicious script there and it will be executed by any user with write access to the directory.

3. **Exploit SUID/SGID Files**:
   - If you find SUID/SGID files that the user can execute or modify, you can create a malicious version of the file that will be executed with higher privileges when the file is run.
   - Modify the SUID/SGID file to point to your malicious script instead of the original binary.
   - If the file is writable by the user, you can simply replace it with your
