1. Ensure that the router is connected to the internet.
        2. Use a network cable to connect the router's LAN port (usually labelled as LAN) to your computer.
        3. Power on the router by connecting its power supply cord to an outlet. If the router has a power light that turns on when it's powered on, then the router has been successfully powered on.
        4. After the router is powered on, it may take several minutes for it to establish network connectivity. To monitor this process, you can use a network monitoring tool that can detect network traffic between devices on the local area network (LAN) segment.
        5. Once the router establishes connectivity to the internet through its WAN port (usually labelled as WAN)), it means that the router has been successfully configured for internet connectivity.
        6. To ensure that the router is configured for the best performance possible, you can adjust various settings within the router's configuration interface. These settings may include adjusting network settings such as MTU size or adjusting the router's firewall settings.
        7. After configuring the router for its best performance possible, it may be recommended that you use a network monitoring tool that can detect network traffic between devices on the local area network (LAN) segment, to monitor the performance of the network and any devices connected to it over time, to ensure that the network is functioning as expected and without any significant network performance issues or degradations that could potentially impact network operations or service quality negatively.
        8. To perform additional security checks and tests on the router, you can use a network security tool that can perform tests on the security settings of devices on a network, including tests for security vulnerabilities within devices and within networks themselves.
        9. After performing additional security checks and tests on the router using a network security tool, if any discrepancies or potential vulnerabilities are found that could potentially impact network operations or service quality negatively, it may be recommended that you take immediate action to remediate or mitigate any such identified vulnerabilities within the router or within its network connection segment.
        10. It is important to keep the router updated with the latest security patches and updates for its operating system and software components, as well as for any other security related updates or patches that may become available for it over time. This ensures that the router has the most up-to-date security measures in place that can protect it against any known security vulnerabilities at that point in time.
        11. To ensure that the router has all of its security measures up-to-date and functioning properly, it may be recommended that you regularly schedule and execute automated security audits and tests on the router, using a network security tool that can perform automated tests on devices on a network for security vulnerabilities, at regular intervals throughout its lifecycle.
        12. After performing automated security audits and tests on the router using a network security tool that can perform automated tests on devices on a network for security vulnerabilities at regular intervals throughout its lifecycle, it may be recommended that you review and assess the findings of these automated security audits and tests, to determine whether any discrepancies or potential vulnerabilities were found that could potentially impact network operations or service quality negatively, and then take appropriate actions to remediate or mitigate any such identified vulnerabilities within the router or within its network connection segment.
