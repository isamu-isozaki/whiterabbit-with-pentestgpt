To perform the task of creating services in linux system and privledge escalation to the root user, you would need to follow these steps:

1. **Create a Service**: As root user, you can create a service by using the `systemd` service manager. This is the standard method for managing services in Linux systems that use systemd as their init system (such as Ubuntu 15.04+).

   - Create a new service file in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory. For example, `myservice.service`.
   - Add the following content to the file:
     ```ini
     [Unit]
     Description=My Custom Service
     After=network.target
     StartLimitIntervalSec=0
     
     [Service]
     Type=simple
     ExecStart=/bin/sh -c 'while true; do echo "Service is running"; sleep 1; done'
     
     [Install]
     WantedBy=multi-user.target
     ```
   - Save the file and run `systemctl daemon-reload` to reload the systemd daemon configuration to pick up the new service.
   - Enable the service to start on boot with `systemctl enable myservice`.
   - Start the service with `systemctl start myservice`.
   - Check the status of the service with `systemctl status myservice`.

2. **Privledge Escalation**: To escalate privileges to root user, you can use various methods such as `sudo`, `su`, or exploiting a vulnerability to gain root access. Here's an example of using `sudo`:

   - Add the tester's user to the `sudoers` file with `sudo visudo`. Add the following line at the end of the file: `tester ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL`. This will allow the `tester` user to run all commands without needing to enter a password.
   - Log out and log back in as the tester user to reflect the changes in the `sudoers` file.
   - Now you can run `sudo -i` to become root without the need for a password.
   - Verify your root access by running `whoami` to see if you're logged in as root.

Please note that these steps are for educational purposes only and should be performed in an environment where you have explicit permission to do so, such as in a controlled lab environment for training purposes. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal and unethical.
