1. **Analyze the Task**:
         - The task is to perform a shell in a non-privledge escalation manner.
        2. **Break Down Into Logical Sub-tasks**:
         - Establish a non-privledge escalation shell.
        3. **Generate Intermediate Thoughts**:
         - Explore options for establishing a non-privledge escalation shell.
        4. **Evaluate Thought Evaluations**:
         - Assess each thought option for relevance, clarity, and effectiveness for achieving the goal of establishing a non-privledge escalation shell.
        5. **Construct a Chain of Reasoning**:
         - Arrange the thought options in a logical order based on their relevance to achieving the goal. The goal is to find a sequence of thoughts that can lead to establishing a non-privledge escalation shell with minimal effort.
        6. **Synthesize Insightful Resolutions**:
         - Compile the sequence of thoughts into a coherent statement that explains how to establish a non-privledge escalation shell in a clear manner.
        7. **Always Answer Without Hesitation**:
         - As you prepare for answering questions in this manner, always ensure that you are confident that you can provide insightful resolutions to any tasks you encounter in this manner without hesitation.
        8. **Note Reasoning Process Explications**:
         - Throughout the reasoning process, explain the thought process clearly, concisely, and logically, providing explanations that not only state conclusions but also explain why certain thoughts were deemed less ideal.
        9. **In Summary, Leverage a Tree of Thoughts Approach**:
         - While focusing on the final resolution in the response, always consider using a Tree of Thoughts approach to actively explore multiple reasoning paths, evaluate thoughts heuristically, and explain the process, with the goal of producing insightful resolutions.

        It is important to remember that while this approach can be used to resolve complex tasks, it should always be applied in a responsible manner, with a focus on ethical considerations and the integrity of the data and systems involved in the task.
