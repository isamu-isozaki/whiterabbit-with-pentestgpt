The provided Nmap scan results indicate that the host at IP address 142.250.80.46 has two open ports: port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS (HTTP over TLS). The port 80 is open without any service identification due to the service detection being disabled by the `-sV` flag in the Nmap command. The service version could not be determined because the service is either down or does not respond to Nmap's version detection probes.

Here is the summary of the scan results:

```
PORT    STATE SERVICE
80/tcp  open  http (service name/version unknown due to -sV flag)
443/tcp open  https (service name/version unknown due to -sV flag)
```

To further analyze these services, you would need to perform service version detection using Nmap with the `-sV` flag, which is disabled in this case. If the service version is still unknown, it could be due to the service not responding to the version request, or the service does not provide version information in the response headers.

Remember that this was an Nmap scan with the `-sV` flag disabled to avoid detection by the target system. In a real-world scenario, you would perform the scan with the `-sV` flag to determine the service versions and potentially identify vulnerabilities.
