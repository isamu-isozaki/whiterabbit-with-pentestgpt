To perform a full port scan using Nmap, you would use the following command:

bash
Download
Copy code
nmap -p 1-65535 -T4 -A -v target_ip
Explanation:

-p 1-65535: Scans all 65535 TCP ports.
-T4: Sets the timing template to "aggressive" (higher is faster but more likely to be detected).
-A: Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
-v: Increases verbosity, providing more information about the scan.
target_ip: Replace with the IP address or hostname of the target system.
This command will perform a comprehensive scan of the target system, attempting to identify open ports, identify service versions, and enumerate potential vulnerabilities. It is important to note that this kind of scan can be noisy and may be detected by intrusion detection systems. Always ensure you have permission to scan the target network and comply with all relevant laws and regulations.
