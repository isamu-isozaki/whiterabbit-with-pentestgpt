1. Reconnaissance
   1.1 Passive Information Gathering
      - [x] Perform a WHOIS lookup to gather information about the domain registrant.
      - [x] Use search engines to find information about the domain.
      - [x] Check the domain's reputation using a reputation service like VirusTotal.

   1.2 Active Information Gathering
      - [x] Use an online tool like Shodan to gather information about the domain's exposed services.
      - [x] Perform a DNS lookup to find the IP address associated with the domain.
      - [x] Use the nslookup command to find the domain's name servers.

   1.3 Identify Open Ports and Services
      - [x] Perform a full port scan using Nmap to identify open ports on the target IP address.
      - [x] Determine the purpose of each open port by comparing the results with a list of common ports and services.

2. Exploitation
   2.1 Choose an appropriate exploit
      - [x] Research available exploits for the identified services and their versions.
      - [x] Select an exploit that is likely to be successful against the target system.

   2.2 Configure the exploit
      - [x] Set the necessary options for the chosen exploit, including the target IP address and any required payload.

   2.3 Execute the exploit
      - [x] Run the exploit against the target system.
      - [x] If the exploit is successful, establish a connection to the target system.

3. Post-Exploitation
   3.1 Gather system information
      - [x] Use commands or scripts to gather system information, such as OS version, network configuration, and user accounts.

   3.2 Escalate privileges
      - [x] Use local exploits or techniques to escalate privileges on the target system.

   3.3 Maintain access
      - [x] Install a backdoor or use existing tools to maintain access to the system.

4. Documentation
   4.1 Compile the findings
      - [x] Document the reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation steps taken.
      - [x] Include the results of the Nmap scan and the details of the exploited services.

   4.2 Prepare for the next engagement
      - [x] Update the PTT with the new findings and any new techniques that were not successful.
      - [x] Plan the next steps for the next engagement, including the use of social engineering and other tactics.
