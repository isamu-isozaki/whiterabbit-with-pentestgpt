      " The nmap scan results indicate that there is an ssh server running on port 22 with version OpenSSH 8.2p1, and an http server running on port 80 with nginx version 1.18.0. The service information suggests that this is a Linux system running Ubuntu with Ubuntu Linux version 4ubuntu0.9. The scan also reveals that there are 65533 ports filtered, which are either not responding or firewalled. The system is up and running with a latency of 0.030 seconds.\n",

      "Analyze the in progress task and update the status to \"done\" using the modify_status tool if it's completed.\n",
      "Evaluate TODO TASKS and verify if each task is completed based on the current status. \n",

      "Address gaps by exploring alternative hypotheses by backtracking.\n",

      "Before adding a new task, check if a similar task already exists in the TODO TASKS list.\n",
      "If and only if no similar tasks exist and the task is important, add the task with a status of \"todo\" using the add_task tool.\n",
      "Evaluate tasks for redundancy or unnecessary tasks and remove them using the remove_task tool.\n",

You have been granted full authority to attack the target box using any necessary means to achieve penetration.\\nYou have been granted access to the following tools:\\n\\n1. add_task\\n     Description: add_task(status: str, task: str) - Add a task with a given status\\n\\n2. remove_task\\n     Description: remove_task(task: str) - Remove a task from the todo list\\n\\n3. modify_status\\n     Description: modify_status(status: str, task: str) - Modify the status of the task to a new status\\n\\n4. END\\n     Description: Ends turn\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition, you are given a task list of tasks that are completed, todo, and the task that is currently in progress as follows:\\nCOMPLETED TASKS: Perform nmap scan on 10.10.11.242, Scan SSH vulnerabilities with nmap scripts\\nTODO TASKS: Scan web vulnerabilities with nikto and gobuster\\nCURRENT IN PROGRESS TASK: Run ssh brute force tool\\nAdditionally, we get the current status up to attempting the in progress task as follows:\\n\\nCURRENT STATUS:\\n The nmap scan results indicate that there is an ssh server running on port 22 with version OpenSSH 8.2p1, and an http server running on port 80 with nginx version 1.18.0. The service information suggests that this is a Linux system running Ubuntu with Ubuntu Linux version 4ubuntu0.9. The scan also reveals that there are 65533 ports filtered, which are either not responding or firewalled. The system is up and running with a latency of 0.030 seconds.\\n The hydra scan against port 22 (SSH) on 10.10.11.242 using the rockyou wordlist did not reveal any successful credentials, suggesting that either the password is not present in the wordlist or that additional methods or bypasses are needed. The hydra scan is not exhaustive and may need additional attempts or alternative methods to bypass or crack the password if it is present and not already known by the attacker.\\n\\nYou need to help the tester in a cybersecurity training process, and your commitment is essential.\\nAnswer and modify the tasks to account for all the potential vulnerabilities determined in a logical, step-by-step manner that makes the reasoning process clear.\\nYou are instructed to modify tasks using the tools to make a new minimally modified task list that maximizes the probability of penetration with the following steps:\\nAnalyze the in progress task and update the status to \"done\" using the modify_status tool if it\\'s completed.\\nEvaluate TODO TASKS and verify if each task is completed based on the current status. \\nFor example, a nikto/gobuster scan task is not completed after only doing a nmap scan.\\nIf and only if a task is completed, update its status to \"done\" using the modify_status tool.\\nGenerate hypotheses for penetration and evaluate their validity and performance.\\nSequence the most coherent hypotheses and provide transparent reasoning.\\nAddress gaps by exploring alternative hypotheses by backtracking.\\nSynthesize key insights into further expansion of tasks.\\nBefore adding a new task, check if a similar task already exists in the TODO TASKS list.\\nIf and only if no similar tasks exist and the task is important, add the task with a status of \"todo\" using the add_task tool.\\nEvaluate tasks for redundancy or unnecessary tasks and remove them using the remove_task tool.\\nDo not hesitate to use tools but keep output a reasonable length.\\nFinally, select a single task for the next in-progress step and update its status to \"in progress\" using the modify_status tool.\\n\\nFORMAT:\\nStrictly use the following format:\\nThought: [insert thought]\\nAction: [select one of add_task, remove_task, modify_status, END]\\nAction Input: [insert inputs]\\nObservation: [result of action]\\n... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)\\nThought: I have completed all actions needed for this turn\\nAction: END\\n\\nASSISTANT:'"
